        <h1 class="titulo text-center">CARDI B</h1>
        <div class="div1-1">Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar (born October 11, 1992),
            known professionally as Cardi B, is an American rapper, songwriter and
            television personality.[2] Born and raised in The Bronx, New York City,
            she first attracted attention for discussing her career as a stripper on 
            social media; she became an Internet celebrity after several of her posts
            and videos went viral on Vine and Instagram.[3] From 2015 to 2017, she
            appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series 
            Love & Hip Hop: New York to follow her music aspirations, and released two
            mixtapes—Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.[4]</div>

        <br>
        <div class="div2-1">Cardi B has earned three number-one singles on the US Billboard
            Hot 100; "Bodak Yellow" made her the second female rapper to top the chart with 
            a solo output—following Lauryn Hill in 1998, "I Like It" made her the first female
            rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart, and her Maroon 5 collaboration
            "Girls Like You" extended that record.[5] Released through Atlantic Records, her 
            critically acclaimed studio album Invasion of Privacy (2018), on which the first two 
            songs were included, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and broke several 
            streaming records.[6][7] That year, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 
            most influential people in the world.[8]</div>
